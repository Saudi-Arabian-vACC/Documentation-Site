---

## 2.6.1 Approach
### 2.6.1.1 General
!!! Example
    **Pilot**: "JEDDAH TOWER, SAUDIA 123 ESTABLISHED RUNWAY 34R"

    **Controller**: "SAUDIA 123, JEDDAH TOWER, PLAN TO VACATE M4, CONTINUE APPROACH RUNWAY 34R NUMBER TWO"

    **Pilot**: "PLAN TO VACATE M4, CONTINUE APPROACH RUNWAY 34R NUMBER TWO, SAUDIA 123"

### 2.6.1.2 Tactical speed
!!! Example
    **Controller**: "SAUDIA 123, REDUCE TO MINIMUM APPROACH SPEED"

    **Pilot**: "REDUCING TO MINIMUM APPROACH SPEED, SAUDIA 123"

### 2.6.1.3 Clearance delay
!!! Example
    **Controller**: "SAUDIA 123, EXPECT LATE LANDING CLEARANCE"

    **Pilot**: "EXPECTING LATE LANDING CLEARANCE, SAUDIA 123"

## 2.6.2 Landing
### 2.6.2.1 General
!!! Example
    **Controller**: "SAUDIA 123, [SURFACE] WIND 340 DEGREES 5 KNOTS, RUNWAY 34R CLEARED TO LAND"

    **Pilot**: "CLEARED TO LAND, RUNWAY 34R, SAUDIA 123"

### 2.6.2.2 RET specific
!!! Example
    **Controller**: "SAUDIA 123, PLAN TO VACATE M6, [SURFACE] WIND 340 DEGREES 5 KNOTS, RUNWAY 34R CLEARED TO LAND"

    **Pilot**: "PLAN TO VACATE M6, CLEARED TO LAND, RUNWAY 34R, SAUDIA 123"

### 2.6.2.3 Touch and go
!!! Example
    **Controller**: "SAUDIA 123, [SURFACE] WIND 340 DEGREES 5 KNOTS, RUNWAY 34R CLEARED TOUCH AND GO"

    **Pilot**: "CLEARED TOUCH AND GO, RUNWAY 34R, SAUDIA 123"

### 2.6.2.4 Cancelling landing clearance
Where air traffic control intends to **cancel a previously issued landing clearance**, and it is anticipated that a new clearance will be issued in sufficient time to permit a safe landing, the following **phraseology** shall be used to prevent the pilot from initiating a missed approach prior to completion of the transmission:
!!! Example
    **Controller**: "SAUDIA 123, CONTINUE APPROACH CANCEL LANDING CLEARANCE [REASON] ACKNOWLEDGE"

    **Pilot**: "LANDING CLEARANCE CANCELLED, CONTINUING APPROACH, SAUDIA 123"
