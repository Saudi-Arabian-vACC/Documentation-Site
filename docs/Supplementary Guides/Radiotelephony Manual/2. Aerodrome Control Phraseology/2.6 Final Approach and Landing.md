|                          **Pilot Transmissions**                         |                                **Controller Transmissions**                                |
|:------------------------------------------------------------------------:|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
|             "JEDDAH TOWER, SAUDIA 123 ESTABLISHED RUNWAY 34R"            |                                                                                            |
|                                                                          | **"SAUDIA 123, JEDDAH TOWER, PLAN TO VACATE M4, CONTINUE APPROACH RUNWAY 34R NUMBER TWO"** |
| "PLAN TO VACATE M4, CONTINUE APPROACH RUNWAY 34R NUMBER TWO, SAUDIA 123" |                                                                                            |

### 2.6.1.2 Tactical speed
!!! Example
    **Controller**: "SAUDIA 123, REDUCE TO MINIMUM APPROACH SPEED"

    **Pilot**: "REDUCING TO MINIMUM APPROACH SPEED, SAUDIA 123"

### 2.6.1.3 Clearance delay
!!! Example
    **Controller**: "SAUDIA 123, EXPECT LATE LANDING CLEARANCE"

    **Pilot**: "EXPECTING LATE LANDING CLEARANCE, SAUDIA 123"

### 2.6.1.4 Wake turbulence
When **wake turbulence** is suspected or known to exist, **ATC** will warn aircraft as appropriate.
!!! Example
    **Controller**: "HZ-HAZ, CAUTION WAKE TURBULENCE FROM DEPARTING [AIRCRAFT TYPE]"

    **Pilot**: "ROGER, HZ-HAZ"

## 2.6.2 Landing
### 2.6.2.1 General
!!! Example
    **Controller**: "SAUDIA 123, [SURFACE] WIND 340 DEGREES 5 KNOTS, RUNWAY 34R CLEARED TO LAND"

    **Pilot**: "CLEARED TO LAND, RUNWAY 34R, SAUDIA 123"

### 2.6.2.2 RET specific
!!! Example
    **Controller**: "SAUDIA 123, PLAN TO VACATE M6, [SURFACE] WIND 340 DEGREES 5 KNOTS, RUNWAY 34R CLEARED TO LAND"

    **Pilot**: "PLAN TO VACATE M6, CLEARED TO LAND, RUNWAY 34R, SAUDIA 123"

### 2.6.2.3 Touch and go
!!! Example
    **Controller**: "SAUDIA 123, [SURFACE] WIND 340 DEGREES 5 KNOTS, RUNWAY 34R CLEARED TOUCH AND GO"

    **Pilot**: "CLEARED TOUCH AND GO, RUNWAY 34R, SAUDIA 123"

### 2.6.2.4 Cancelling landing clearance
Where air traffic control intends to **cancel a previously issued landing clearance**, and it is anticipated that a new clearance will be issued in sufficient time to permit a safe landing, the following **phraseology** shall be used to prevent the pilot from initiating a missed approach prior to completion of the transmission:
!!! Example
    **Controller**: "SAUDIA 123, CONTINUE APPROACH CANCEL LANDING CLEARANCE [REASON] ACKNOWLEDGE"

    **Pilot**: "LANDING CLEARANCE CANCELLED, CONTINUING APPROACH, SAUDIA 123"

## 2.6.3 After landing
The **tower controller** should ensure the arriving aircraft is clear of the **rapid exit taxiway** before handing the aircraft over to **ground movement control**. In this situation, the tower controller may provide an initial taxi instruction to ensure an expeditious flow of traffic and to keep the rapid exit taxiway clear for the next arriving aircraft.

## 2.6.4 Go around
If the runway is not available for landing, to ensure **ATC separation**, or to avert an unsafe situation, the appropriate instruction will be given. Any transmissions to aircraft should be **brief** and kept to a minimum.

- Only if time permits, a **reason** for the go **around** instruction should be included.
!!! Example
    **Controller**: "SAUDIA 123, GO AROUND I SAY AGAIN GO AROUND ACKNOWLEDGE"

    **Pilot**: "GOING AROUND, SAUDIA 123"

- In the event that this procedure is initiated by the pilot, the phrase **“GOING AROUND”** will be used. Unless instructed otherwise, an IFR aircraft will carry out the **missed approach procedure**, and a **VFR aircraft** will continue in the normal traffic circuit.
!!! Example
    **Pilot**: "SAUDIA 123, GOING AROUND"

    **Controller**: "SAUDIA 123, GO AROUND CLIMB 4000 FT FLY STANDARD MISSED APPROACH PROCEDURE"

    **Pilot**: "HZ-HAZ, GOING AROUND"

    **Controller**: "HZ-HAZ, EXPEDITE CROSSWIND WHEN ABLE, REPORT DOWNWIND WITH INTENTION"
