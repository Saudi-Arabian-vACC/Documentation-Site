title: 2.1 Clearance Delivery
---

## 2.1.1 Clearances and read back requirements
Controller should pass a clearance considering that the pilot may need to write it down.
Aircraft clearances should be passed prior to start-up and, in any case, controllers should avoid
passing a clearance during high cockpit workload periods, or when an aircraft is lining up or taking
off.

A pilot is required to acknowledge receipt of the following ATC clearances, information, or
instruction by a full readback followed by the aircraft callsign:

- ATC route, taxi, approach and departure clearances and amendments thereto
- Clearances to VFR aircraft to operate within controlled airspace, to enter or vacate the
circuit
- Clearances and instructions to enter, land on, take off from, hold short of, cross and
backtrack on any runway
- Runway in use, altimeter settings, SSR codes, level instructions, heading and speed
instructions, transition levels and frequency change instructions whether these have been
issued by the controller or contained in an ATIS broadcast
- Instructions to push back and taxi on the movement area
- Conditional clearances

Clearances from clearance delivery controllers should include:

- **Aircraft callsign**
- **Confirmation of destination**
- **Assigned departure** (RNAV SID or Omnidirectional instructions)
- **Assigned runway**
- **Initial altitude**
- **Assigned squawk code**

## 2.1.2 Squawk code assignment
Controllers must actively listen to, and insist upon, a correct readback to ensure that the clearance or instruction has been properly acknowledged. If any discrepancies are identified in the readback or if a readback is missing, controllers shall take immediate action to correct the error.

### 2.1.2.1 General (Single Runway)
!!! Example
    **Controller**: "SAUDIA 123 CLEARED TO RIYADH AS FILE, EGREP2W DEPARTURE, INITIAL CLIMB 6000 FT, SQUAWK 2515"

    **Pilot**: "CLEARED TO RIYADH AS FILE, EGREP2W DEPARTURE, INITIAL CLIMB 6000 FT, SQUAWK 2515, SAUDIA 123"

    **Controller**: "SAUDIA 123, [READBACK] CORRECT, INFORMATION A, REPORT READY FOR PUSH AND START"

    **Pilot**: "INFORMATION A, WILCO, SAUDIA 123"

### 2.1.2.2 General (Dual Runway)
!!! Example
    **Controller**: "SAUDIA 123 CLEARED TO RIYADH AS FILE, EGREP3V DEPARTURE RUNWAY 34R, INITIAL CLIMB 6000 FT, SQUAWK 2515"

    **Pilot**: "CLEARED TO RIYADH AS FILE, EGREP3V DEPARTURE RUNWAY 34R, INITIAL CLIMB 6000 FT, SQUAWK 2515, SAUDIA 123"

    **Controller**: "SAUDIA 123, [READBACK] CORRECT, INFORMATION A, REPORT READY FOR PUSH AND START"

    **Pilot**: "INFORMATION A, WILCO, SAUDIA 123"

## 2.1.3 Correct readback
If the aircrafts readback was correct, the clearance delivery controller should acknowledge this with
the phrase **“READBACK CORRECT”** and proceed to pass across details of active ATIS letter along with
local QNH.

## 2.1.4 Incorrect readback
If an aircraft readback is incorrect, the controller will transmit **“NEGATIVE, I SAY AGAIN”** followed by
the correct version.
!!! Example
    **Controller**: "SAUDIA 123, SQUAWK 2515"

    **Pilot**: "SQUAWK 2510, SAUDIA 123"

    **Controller**: "SAUDIA 123, NEGATIVE I SAY AGAIN SQUAWK 2515"

    **Pilot**: "SQUAWK 2515, SAUDIA 123"

## 2.1.5 Aircraft unable an instruction
If there is a doubt as to whether a pilot can comply with an ATC clearance or instruction, the
controller may follow the clearance or instruction by the phrase “IF UNABLE”, and subsequently
offer an alternative. If at any time a pilot receives a clearance or instruction which cannot be
complied with, that pilot shall advise the controller using the phrase “UNABLE” and give the reasons
!!! Example
    **Pilot**: "UNABLE SID, DUE AIRCRAFT EQUIPMENT REQUEST OMNIDIRECTIONAL DEPARTURE, FLYNAS 123"

    **Controller**: "FLYNAS 123, ROGER EXPECT OMNIDIRECTIONAL DEPARTURE"

## 2.1.6 Reclearance
When an ATC route clearance is changed for ATC reasons or following an aircraft request,
instructions will be passed in the form of a reclearance
!!! Example
    **Controller**: "SAUDIA 123, RECLEARED VIA EGREP2W, RUNWAY 34C REST OF CLEARANCE REMAINS UNCHANGED"

    **Pilot**: "ROGER, RECLEARED VIA EGREP2W, RUNWAY 34C REST OF CLEARANCE REMAINS UNCHANGED, SAUDIA 123"

    **Controller**: "SAUDIA 123, NEW CRUISING LEVEL FL340"

    **Pilot**: "ROGER, NEW CRUISING LEVEL FL340, SAUDIA 123"

## 2.1.7 Omnidirectional or radar departures
Some aircraft may be unable to fly an RNAV SID, or simply may not have the latest RNAV SIDs
installed into their aircraft. In this situation, controllers shall issue an omnidirectional departure. This includes:

- The **departure runway**
- A **heading** to fly after departure (normally runway heading)
- The **altitude** to climb to after departure
- Assigned **squawk** code

### 2.1.7.1 Omnidirectional Departure
!!! Example
    **Controller**: "SAUDIA 123 CLEARED TO RIYADH AS FILE, OMNIDIRECTIONAL DEPARTURE RUNWAY 34R, MAINTAIN RUNWAY HEADING, INITIAL CLIMB 6000 FT, SQUAWK 2515"

    **Pilot**: "CLEARED TO RIYADH AS FILE, OMNIDIRECTIONAL DEPARTURE RUNWAY 34R, MAINTAIN RUNWAY HEADING, INITIAL CLIMB 6000 FT, SQUAWK 2515, SAUDIA 123"

    **Controller**: "SAUDIA 123, [READBACK] CORRECT, INFORMATION A, REPORT READY FOR PUSH AND START"

    **Pilot**: "INFORMATION A, WILCO, SAUDIA 123"

### 2.1.7.2 Radar Departure (Dammam Specific)
!!! Example
    **Controller**: "SAUDIA 123 CLEARED TO RIYADH AS FILE, DAMMAM1A DEPARTURE RUNWAY 34L, FLY HEADING 325 AFTER DEPARTURE, INITIAL CLIMB 4000 FT, SQUAWK 2515"

    **Pilot**: "CLEARED TO RIYADH AS FILE, DAMMAM1A DEPARTURE RUNWAY 34L, FLY HEADING 325 AFTER DEPARTURE, INITIAL CLIMB 4000 FT, SAUDIA 123"

    **Controller**: "SAUDIA 123, [READBACK] CORRECT, INFORMATION A, REPORT READY FOR PUSH AND START"

    **Pilot**: "INFORMATION A, WILCO, SAUDIA 123"
