title: 2.5 Visual Flight Rules
---

## 2.5.1 General
**Visual Flight Rules (VFR)** govern the operation of aircraft under **Visual Meteorological Conditions (VMC)**, which are conditions that allow flight to be conducted solely by visual reference. Due to the minimal communication and navigation equipment required for VFR operations, such aircraft may face certain restrictions when operating within controlled airspace.

## 2.5.2 VFR departures
Departure clearances may specify a **Control Zone (CTR) sector**, a **VFR Departure Procedure**, or provide **plain-language instructions**.

Upon leaving the aerodrome traffic circuit, aircraft shall enter and remain within the lateral limits of the sector specified in the clearance, or comply with the assigned route as detailed in the VFR Departure Procedure or clearance.

Altitude instructions, where applicable, are published within the VFR Departure Procedures.

### 2.5.2.1 General
!!! Example
    **Controller**: "HZ-MAZ, LEAVE THE JEDDAH CONTROL ZONE TO THE NORTH, ALTITUDE 2000FT, SQUAWK XXXX"

    **Pilot**: “LEAVE THE JEDDAH CONTROL ZONE TO THE NORTH, ALTITUDE 2000FT VFR, SQUAWK XXXX, HZ-MAZ”

### 2.5.2.2 Riyadh Specific
!!! Example
    **Controller**: "HZ-MAZ, LEAVE THE RIYADH CONTROL ZONE VIA WEST GATE, ALTITUDE 4000FT, SQUAWK XXXX"

    **Pilot**: “LEAVE THE RIYADH CONTROL ZONE VIA WEST GATE, ALTITUDE 4000FT VFR, SQUAWK XXXX, HZ-MAZ”


## 2.5.3 VFR circuits
Occasionally, aircraft may wish to join and remain in the circuit. Aircraft may perform following multiple approaches and landings:

- Touch and go
- Stop and go
- Low approach
- Full stop

!!! Example
    **Controller**: "HZ-MAZ, AFTER DEPARTURE, JOIN LEFT HAND CIRCUIT RUNWAY 34L, ALTITUDE 1500FT, SQUAWK 2413"

    **Pilot**: “AFTER DEPARTURE, JOIN LEFT HAND CIRCUIT RUNWAY 34L, ALTITUDE 1500FT, SQUAWK 2413, HZ-MAZ"

## 2.5.4 VFR arrivals
The initial call to aerodrome control requesting clearance to enter a **CTR (control zone)** must be made in sufficient time to allow the controller to assess both **VFR** and **IFR traffic** situations and issue a clearance before the aircraft reaches the CTR boundary by **10 nautical miles**. Pilots must be advised if they are to operate in **special VFR conditions (SVFR)**.

Arrival clearances may include a CTR sector, a VFR Arrival Procedure, plain language instructions, or circuit joining instructions. Aircraft must remain within the lateral limits of any sector in the clearance, follow the assigned route in the VFR Arrival Procedure or the clearance, and comply with circuit joining and reporting instructions. Altitude instructions are also included in the VFR arrival clearance.

### 2.5.4.1 Entry clearance (Without VRPs)
!!! Example
    **Pilot**: "JEDDAH TOWER, HZ-HAZ SOUTHBOUND 2000FT, REQUESTING CLEARANCE TO ENTER THE CONTROL ZONE"

    **Controller**: "HZ-HAZ, JEDDAH TOWER, CLEARED TO ENTER THE CONTROL ZONE VIA SOUTH, MAINTAIN ALTITUDE 2000FT, SQUAWK 7000 REPORT ENTERING THE CONTROL ZONE"

    **Pilot**: "CLEARED TO ENTER THE CONTROL ZONE VIA SOUTH, MAINTAIN ALTITUDE 2000FT, SQUAWK 7000, WILL REPORT ENTERING THE CONTROL ZONE, HZ-HAZ"

### 2.5.4.2 Entry clearance (With VRPs)
!!! Example
    **Pilot**: "RIYADH TOWER, HZ-HAZ WESTHBOUND 4000FT, REQUESTING CLEARANCE TO ENTER THE CONTROL ZONE"

    **Controller**: "HZ-HAZ, RIYADH TOWER, CLEARED TO ENTER THE CONTROL ZONE VIA WEST GATE, MAINTAIN ALTITUDE 4000FT, SQUAWK 7000 REPORT OVERHEAD WEST GATE"

    **Pilot**: "CLEARED TO ENTER THE CONTROL ZONE VIA WEST GATE, MAINTAIN ALTITUDE 4000FT, SQUAWK 7000 WILL REPORT OVERHEAD WEST GATE, HZ-HAZ"

## 2.5.5 Position reporting points and instrucions
### 2.5.5.1 Class D airspace
!!! Example
    **Pilot**: "DOWNWIND RUNWAY 34L FOR TOUCH AND GO, HZ-HAZ"

    **Controller**: "HZ-HAZ, ROGER REPORT FINAL RUNWAY 34L, NUMBER ONE"

    ---

    **Pilot**: "DOWNWIND RUNWAY 34L FOR TOUCH AND GO RUNWAY 34C, HZ-HAZ"

    **Controller**: "HZ-HAZ, WHEN ABLE JOIN LEFT BASE RUNWAY 34C, REPORT FINAL NUMBER ONE"

### 2.5.5.3 Class C airspace
!!! Example
    **Pilot**: "DOWNWIND RUNWAY 33L FOR TOUCH AND GO, HZ-HAZ"

    **Controller**: "HZ-HAZ, ROGER EXTEND DOWNWIND RUNWAY 33L, I WILL CALL YOUR BASE LEG"

## 2.5.6 Sequencing traffic circuits
### 2.5.6.1 VFR to VFR
!!! Example
    **Controller**: "HZ-HAZ, TRAFFIC IS CESSNA 172, 10 O'CLOCK TURNING CROSSWING RUNWAY 34L, REPORT IN SIGHT"

    **Pilot**: "TRAFFIC IN SIGHT, HZ-HAZ"

    **Controller**: "HZ-HAZ, MAINTAIN VISUAL SEPARATION, REPORT DOWNWIND WITH INTENTIONS NUMBER 2 IN SEQUENCE"

### 2.5.6.2 VFR to IFR
!!! Example
    **Controller**: "HZ-HAZ, TRAFFIC IS SAUDIA BOEING 777, 2 O'CLOCK FINAL RUNWAY 34R, REPORT IN SIGHT"

    **Pilot**: "TRAFFIC IN SIGHT, HZ-HAZ"

    **Controller**: "HZ-HAZ, MAINTAIN VISUAL SEPARATION, REPORT FINAL RUNWAY 34R NUMBER 2 IN SEQUENCE"

    ---

    **Controller**: "SAUDIA 123, TRAFFIC IS CESSNA 172, 2 O'CLOCK DOWNWIND RUNWAY 34R, NO FACTOR"

    **Pilot**: "ROGER TRAFFIC IN SIGHT, SAUDIA 123"
