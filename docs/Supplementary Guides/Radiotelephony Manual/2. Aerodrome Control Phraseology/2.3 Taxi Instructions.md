title: 2.3 Taxi Instructions
---

## 2.3.1 Taxi clearance
The pilot of the aircraft is required to state their location when either requesting to start engines,
pushback or when requesting taxi clearance

Taxi instructions issued by a controller will always contain a **clearance limit**, which is the point at
which the aircraft must stop until further permission to proceed is given. For departing aircraft, the clearance limit will normally be the taxi-holding point of the runway in use, but it may be any other position on the aerodrome depending on the prevailing traffic circumstances.
!!! info "Do note"
    When a taxi clearance includes a taxi limit extending beyond a runway, it shall specify either an explicit **clearance to cross** or an **instruction to hold short** of that runway.

### 2.3.1.1 Clearance Limits
!!! Example
    **Pilot**: "JEDDAH APRON, SAUDIA 123 STAND A11, REQUEST TAXI"

    **Controller**: "TAXI VIA LA, L2, HOLD SHORT OF L"

    **Pilot**: "TAXI VIA LA, L2, HOLD SHORT OF L, SAUDIA 123"

### 2.3.1.2 Give way instructions
When a controller identifies an aircraft that may cross the pilotâ€™s expected path, a **give-way instruction** is issued to prevent conflict.
!!! Example
    **Pilot**: "JEDDAH GROUND, HZ-MAZ, STAND G51, REQUEST TAXI"

    **Controller**: "HZ-MAZ, TAXI TO HOLDING POINT RUNWAY 34L VIA D4, C, U, GIVE WAY TO THE SAUDIA B777 PASSING RIGHT TO LEFT"

    **Pilot**: "TAXI TO HOLDING POINT RUNWAY 34L VIA D4, C, U, GIVING WAY TO THE SAUDIA B777 PASSING RIGHT TO LEFT, HZ-MAZ"
